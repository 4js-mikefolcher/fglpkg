The repository is auto-detected from the git 'origin' remote when present
(SCP-style remotes are normalised to https) and offered as the default;
otherwise you are prompted for it. A final prompt offers the optional
Genero version constraint, showing the detected runtime version.

With --yes, or when stdin is not a terminal (CI, scaffolding), init runs
non-interactively: it accepts the defaults (directory name, version 0.1.0,
UNLICENSED, detected repository) without prompting.

                           of re-resolving. For CI and deployment builds

With no package arguments, installs everything declared in fglpkg.json.

Install converges .fglpkg/ on fglpkg.json: a dependency you delete from the
manifest by hand is re-resolved out of fglpkg-lock.json AND deleted from disk, so it
stops appearing in 'fglpkg list' and stops resolving on FGLLDPATH. Pruning
applies to local (.fglpkg/) installs only — a global ~/.fglpkg/ is shared
across projects — and is skipped under --production, which resolves a
deliberately narrowed graph.

Installed packages are verified against the registry's Ed25519 signature by
default (mode "warn": a bad or missing signature warns but does not block).
Set signing.enforce to "require" in ~/.fglpkg/config.json, or FGLPKG_SIGNING=
require|warn|off, to change this.
With one or more <package>[@<version>] arguments, resolves and adds them.
Without --local/--global, the target is auto-detected: local when a
.fglpkg/ directory or fglpkg.json exists in the current directory.

Drops the package from fglpkg.json, re-resolves the remaining graph, and

Ignores fglpkg-lock.json and re-resolves every dependency to the newest version
allowed by the manifest constraints.

Like install, update then converges .fglpkg/ on the resolved graph: anything it
no longer requires is deleted from disk. Local (.fglpkg/) installs only — a
global ~/.fglpkg/ is shared across projects.

Prints the installed dependency tree: at every level, Genero packages and
webcomponents first, then the Java JARs they pull in. A subtree already shown
above is collapsed to a "(*)" leaf rather than repeated.

Package parentage comes from fglpkg-lock.json. JAR parentage is not recorded there,
so it is read from each installed package's bundled fglpkg.json — a JAR no
installed manifest declares is shown at the top level.

Needs a fglpkg-lock.json in the current directory. Without one — and always under
--global, which has no lock — the output falls back to --flat.

Prints shell statements that prepend the package paths. Load them with:
  sh / bash / zsh    eval "$(fglpkg env --global)"
  PowerShell         fglpkg env --global --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression
  Command Prompt     fglpkg env --global --shell cmd > setup-env.bat
                     call setup-env.bat

Use --shell sh under Git Bash or WSL on Windows. Values are quoted only when
they contain a character the shell would otherwise split on, so paths of
ordinary characters are emitted exactly as earlier releases emitted them.

Command Prompt cannot represent a path containing a literal '%' or '"'; fglpkg
warns on stderr and emits the line anyway. Use --shell powershell for those.
Prefer a .bat file over 'FOR /F ... DO %i': a %VAR% reference read from stdout
is not re-expanded, so that recipe silently loses the inherited value.

  FGLPROFILE               config files declared by a package's "profile"

Existing values are preserved — fglpkg prepends. Diagnostics (such as two
packages shipping the same resource basename, where first-on-path wins) are
written to STDERR so stdout stays safe to eval.

Nothing is hidden or reordered — the marker is advisory. Registries that don't
report a Genero constraint, or a version that can't be detected, show ?.

When secondary repositories are configured, search fans out to every repository
and tags each result with its source repo. A repository that fails to respond
is reported as a warning without failing the whole search. (Compatibility is
not graded for secondary-repository results — they always show ?.)

                           On the GI registry this overwrites a pending/rejected
                           variant in place (an approved/published version stays

                           fglpkg.json and files matched by "docs"). Off by
                           default: such a publish is refused with an actionable
                           message.

Builds the package zip, uploads it, and submits the version for admin review.
When --registry names an Artifactory repository, the zip and its sidecar
fglpkg.json are deployed directly (no submit/approval step).

DEFAULT TARGET:
  With no --registry, publish targets the default repository, resolved in
  decreasing precedence: the FGLPKG_PUBLISH_REGISTRY environment variable, the
  project's "defaultRegistry" field in fglpkg.json, then the global
  ~/.fglpkg/config.json "defaultRegistry". If none is set, publish goes to the
  GI registry (the historical default). A team publishing to their own
  Artifactory can set "defaultRegistry" once and omit --registry thereafter.

CHANGELOG:
  When --changelog is not given, publish looks for a CHANGELOG.md in the project
  root and sends the section whose heading names the version being published
  (Keep a Changelog format, e.g. "## [1.2.0]"). If the file exists but has no
  entry for the version, the changelog is sent empty and a warning is printed.

Reports (among others):
  - malformed or mistyped manifest fields, named in plain language
  - a 'files' or 'docs' pattern that matches no files
  - a declared 'program' with no matching staged .42m module
  - a package that would publish with no assets — only fglpkg.json and files
    matched by 'docs' (warning; 'fglpkg publish' refuses it unless --allow-empty)
  - BDL source under 'root' that no 'files' pattern staged, so the package would
    ship no BDL at all (error — usually a wrong 'root'/'files')
  - missing publish metadata: description, license, repository, author (warning)

The same validation runs automatically inside 'fglpkg pack' and
'fglpkg publish', so these problems cannot be skipped. Errors block; warnings
are advisory and do not stop pack/publish on their own.

  --registry <name>        Sign in to a configured secondary repository (e.g. a
                           JFrog Artifactory repo) instead of the default GI
                           registry. The credential type follows the repo's
                           declared auth scheme (see below).
  --user <u> --password <p>  Basic auth for a --registry with auth "basic"
                           (the password may be an account password or a token)
  --api-key <k>            API key for a --registry with auth "apikey"

With no flags, opens a browser to complete an OAuth (code + PKCE) login to the
GI registry.

SECONDARY REPOSITORIES:
  'fglpkg login --registry <name>' stores credentials for a repository declared
  in fglpkg.json / ~/.fglpkg/config.json, keyed by its URL. The flag to use
  depends on that repo's "auth" scheme:
    bearer     --token <access-token>        (recommended for Artifactory)
    basic      --user <u> --password <p|token>
    apikey     --api-key <key>
    anonymous  no login needed
  Credentials for GI and every secondary repo coexist — logging in to one never
  affects another.

NOTE:
  FGLPKG_TOKEN, when set, authenticates the GI registry ahead of any stored
  login, so a GI login has no visible effect until that variable is unset.

                           file, so install/update/search/info/outdated resolve from it

Repositories are configured via a "registries" array in fglpkg.json and/or
~/.fglpkg/config.json, alongside the built-in Genero Intelligence registry.
Lower "priority" is tried first; priorities must be unique. 'add'/'remove' edit
these files for you; credentials still flow through 'fglpkg login --registry'.

LOGIN column values:
  yes     credentials are stored for this repo (via 'fglpkg login')
  env     the GI registry is authenticated by the FGLPKG_TOKEN env var
  no      no usable credentials found
  anon    the repo's auth scheme is "anonymous" (no login required)

DEFAULT column values:
  consume  install/update/search/info/outdated resolve from this repo by default
  publish  'fglpkg publish' targets this repo by default
  both     this repo serves both defaults
  -        no default points here

Sign in to a secondary repo with 'fglpkg login --registry <name>'. Set which
repo 'fglpkg publish' targets by default with a top-level "defaultRegistry" in
fglpkg.json (or the FGLPKG_PUBLISH_REGISTRY env var), and which repo packages
are consumed from with "defaultConsumeRegistry" (or FGLPKG_CONSUME_REGISTRY /
'registry add --consume-default'). The consume default is exclusion, not
precedence: only that repo is consulted, so a name in two repos is never
silently tie-broken. A per-dependency "registry" pin and an explicit
--registry both override it.

'fglpkg sbom' stay in step without a re-install. A lock whose schema
this fglpkg does not understand is left untouched.

the lockfile, unless it is gitignored), commits, and creates a
